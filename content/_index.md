# About
My name is Preston. I'm a software developer with a focus on application
development (web, mobile, & desktop). I also have the unique ability to convert
caffine directly into code.

# Projects
## [Scrapey](https://github.com/Preston-Harrison/scrapey)
When trying to web scrape, I kept getting IP blocked. IP rotation services are
pretty expensive, so I thought I'd use my friends' & family's WiFi networks instead.
The usual way of using other networks is to set up a [forward proxy](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-forward-proxy)
however this requires the network to have a public IP, which most residential WiFi networks
don't have. I took this as an opportunity to deep dive into how HTTP and proxies work, and in
doing so created a tool that allows networks without public IPs to be used as proxies. 
Check it out [here](https://github.com/Preston-Harrison/scrapey).
